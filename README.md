# Password Manager

Hi, The main motive of the mini password manager app was to build a secure data storage platform. With this app we will be able to store our passwords of every website in a more secure manner in our local computer storage instead of web. We will be also able to fetch the stored password to get hold of the email and passwords of a particular website. This app also hold the capability of creating complicated passwords with alpha-numeric symbol combinations. For better user interface added some GUI features using message box in tkinter module, like asking for the confirmation of password, showing popup of successful saving of password and copying the generated password directly to clipboard using paperclip module in python.


## Dont worry everything is secure in our hand

Thank you!
